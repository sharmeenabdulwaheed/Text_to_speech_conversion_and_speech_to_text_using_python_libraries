# Text to Speech Conversion and Speech to Text using Python Libraries

This project demonstrates both text-to-speech (TTS) conversion and speech-to-text (STT) transcription using Python libraries. The implementation allows converting written text to spoken audio as well as transcribing spoken audio back into text.

## Features

- **Text to Speech (TTS):**
  - Convert any written text into natural-sounding speech.
  - Save the generated audio to a file.

- **Speech to Text (STT):**
  - Transcribe spoken words from an audio file to written text.
  - Supports common audio formats.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech)
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **PyAudio** (for microphone input, if used)
- **pydub** (for audio file manipulation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script for either text-to-speech or speech-to-text functionality as per your need.
